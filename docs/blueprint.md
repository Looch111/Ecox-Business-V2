## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) for a calm, trustworthy interface. This hue creates a professional yet inviting atmosphere.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that makes the content stand out. This desaturated tint maintains focus on the forms and user inputs.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) as a secondary color for highlights and interactive elements. This contrasts with the primary while remaining harmonious, drawing user attention to calls to action without being jarring.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif offering a blend of modernity and warmth, for clear and inviting text throughout the application.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience. Use fade-in effects when displaying content and smooth transitions on button hover states.
- Use clear, intuitive layouts with a focus on usability. Employ a single-column layout for forms to guide the user through each step.
